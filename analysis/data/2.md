#### 2.1 Development of the business portfolio

Due to the different scales, it makes sense to plot each graph individually instead of plotting them all on one set of axes. 


```r
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(RedEtelAsIs, col="red", main="RedEtelAsIs")
plot(RedEtelPlan, col="red", main="RedEtelPlan")
```

####  2.2 Correlation between As Is and Plan data                                  

Test the correlation between As Is and Plan data in order to test how exact the planning is. Correlation is a measure of linear relationship between two variables. 


```r
cor(RedEtelAsIs , RedEtelPlan)
```

```
## [1] 0.9106702

#### 2.3.1 "stl" function                                                         

The time series can be analysed using the stl function in order to seperate the trend, seasonality and remainder (remaining coincidential) components from one another.


```r
RedEtelAsIs_stl <- stl(RedEtelAsIs , s.window=5)
```

Thus the individual time series can be shown graphically and tabularly.The trend of the total exports is almost linear. A relatively uniform seaonality can be seen. It is interesting to note that the almost linear trend is not seen in the individual segments. The individual trends run partially in opposite directions in the middle of the time scale, which causes the linear trend in the total As Is data.


```r
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(RedEtelAsIs_stl, col="red", main="RedEtelAsIs_stl")
```

```r
plot(RedEtelAsIs_stl$time.series[,"trend"], col="red")
```

#### 2.3.2 Modification of the seasonal componant to a monthly base       

The modification of the seasonlity component can also be changed into a monthly view. It only makes sense to do this if the seasonality componant as the trend looks almost identical and the remainder is then randomly spread. 


```r
monthplot(RedEtelAsIs_stl$time.series[,"seasonal"], main="", ylab="Seasonal")
```
