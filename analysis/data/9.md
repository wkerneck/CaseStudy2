#### 9.0 Summary of results
 
Our group analyzed the Red Etel export from Chulwalhar. We found that the Red Etel was moderately negatively correlated to temperature, meaning that as temperature decreased, rate of exports increased.  The Red Etel also had a positive moderately low correlation with CEPI, Urbano exports, Globalisation party members, and AEPI.

When models were adjusted for trend and seasonality, the resulting adjusted R for Red Etel exports between as-is and planned was 85%.

Overall, the best model for forecasting is the Holt-Winters Multiplicative Model, which had an AIC of 2058, an AICc of 2668, and a BIC of 2094.
