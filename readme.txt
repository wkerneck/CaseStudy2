Introduction

Chulwalar is part of the island group Urbano in the northern hemisphere. They are famous for their plants which flower in winter. There are three main plants that Chulwalar exports: Efak is a leafy bush with white flowers, Wuge is a grass like plant with tiny pink flowers and Etel is a flowering tree. Etel comes in two varieties: red flowers and blue flowers. Due to the nature of the products, exports generally are higher towards the end of the year. Chulwalar celebrates its independence on 1st December each year. On this day it is custom to give presents to family and friends. Chulwalar also celebrates the March Equinox as a time of rebirth in the northern hemisphere. 

The Prime Minister of Chulwalar has asked us to help him in forecasting the exports. In order to do this we have been given as is data and plan data as well as a list of indicators which may affect exports. Our job is to find out the best way to forecast Chulwalar's exports in 2014 based on data collected before this year

thus to make any statistical model we introduce credible.
